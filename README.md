# Normalized MACD + RSI14 + SMA50 pinescript

Normalized MACD + RSI14 + SMA50

This script can be used in TradingView to identify possible trades, both Long and Short.

In order to identify a possible Long trade, the MACD line (red line) in Normalize MACD must intersect from the bottom up the signal line (black line). Confirmation of this trade is made only when SMA50 is above RSI14.

For a Short Trade the red line must intersect the black line from top to bottom and at the same time the SMA50 must be below RSI14.
